2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[0].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs/IBUFDS_0 (in Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[0].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[1].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs/IBUFDS_0 (in Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[1].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer QSPI_ss_iobuf_0/IBUF (in QSPI_ss_iobuf_0 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of Mars_AX3_i/Memory/SDRAM/u_Mars_AX3_SDRAM_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 Mars_AX3_i/Ethernet/axi_ethernet/U0/eth_buf/U0/RCV_INTFCE_I/RX_DP_MEM_IF_I/I_RXS_MEM/xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg has an input control pin Mars_AX3_i/Ethernet/axi_ethernet/U0/eth_buf/U0/RCV_INTFCE_I/RX_DP_MEM_IF_I/I_RXS_MEM/xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg/ENARDEN (net: Mars_AX3_i/Ethernet/axi_ethernet/U0/eth_buf/U0/RCV_INTFCE_I/RX_DP_MEM_IF_I/I_RXS_MEM/xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_6) which is driven by a register (Mars_AX3_i/Ethernet/axi_ethernet/U0/eth_buf/U0/COMBINE_RESETS/AXI_RESET_TO_RXS_AXSTREAM/ClkB_reset_inst/async_rst4_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port DDR3_DM[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port DDR3_DM[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (Mars_AX3_i/Ethernet/axi_dma/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_GP_SF.I_S2MM_GP_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
